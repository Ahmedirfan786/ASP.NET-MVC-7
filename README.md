ASP.NET MVC is a web application framework from Microsoft that implements the Model-View-Controller pattern. It separates an application into three main components: the Model (data and business logic), the View (user interface), and the Controller (handles user input and updates the model). This architecture promotes modular development, testability, and flexibility in web application design, allowing developers to efficiently build and maintain scalable and interactive web applications using .NET technologies.
